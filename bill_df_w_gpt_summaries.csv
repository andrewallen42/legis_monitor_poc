9688,"  People Over Long Lines Act (POLL Act) This bill sets forth provisions related to voting and the administration of federal elections. Specifically, the bill requires states to ensure that voters wait no more than 30 minutes at any polling place to cast their vote in a federal election, establishes a private right of action for voters who experience longer waiting times, and directs the Election Assistance Commission to make payments to eligible states to prevent unreasonable waiting times. Next, the bill requires each state to provide for the minimum required number of voting systems, poll workers, and other election resources for each polling location on the day of any federal election and each day of early voting. The Department of Justice must issue uniform standards regarding the minimum number and distribution of such systems, workers, and other resources.  The bill also prohibits a chief state election administration official from taking an active part in political management or in a political campaign with respect to any federal election over which the official has supervisory authority, with certain exceptions."," A BILL To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to ensure that voters in elections for Federal office do not wait in long lines in order to vote. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``People Over Long Lines Act (POLL Act)''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) The right to vote for all Americans is fundamental and rules for voting and election administration should protect the right to vote and promote voter participation. (2) It is the responsibility of the State and Federal governments to ensure that every eligible citizen is able to register to vote and to cast a ballot. (3) There continues to be an alarming movement to erect barriers to make it more difficult for Americans to participate in our Nation's democratic process. The Nation has witnessed unprecedented efforts to turn back the clock and erect barriers to voting for communities of color, which have faced historic and continuing discrimination, as well as disabled, young, elderly, and low-income Americans. (4) One way voting in communities of color has been suppressed is through long waits at polling locations. Studies have shown a number of contributing factors, including the drastic reduction of early voting days, poor allocation of resources to certain communities, cuts to election funding, and a reduction of polling locations. (5) A 2019 study led by economist Keith Chen of the University of California, Los Angeles, matched anonymous location data from 10,000,000 smartphones to 93,000 polling places to create the most extensive map to date of voter wait times across the United States. The results showed one very clear disparity: voters in predominantly Black neighborhoods waited 29 percent longer, on average, than those in White neighborhoods. They were also about 74 percent more likely to wait for more than half an hour. (6) Waiting in long lines discourages people from voting, undermines confidence in the electoral system, and imposes economic costs on voters. (7) Long lines are estimated to have deterred between 500,000 and 700,000 people from casting their ballot in 2012. (8) These problems led to the creation of the bipartisan Presidential Commission on Election Administration, which issued a 2014 report that set forth a standard: ``No citizen should have to wait more than 30 minutes to vote.''. (9) Despite the work of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration, long lines continue, particularly in communities of color where racial discrimination in voting is a clear and persistent problem. (10) In the Arizona 2016 Presidential primary, in one Maricopa County polling place for mostly Latino voters, some waited for 4 hours or more in the 80-degree heat to cast their ballots. For the 2016 general election, 3 people collapsed while waiting to vote in an hours-long line in Georgia, and a line to vote in Cincinnati, Ohio was a half-mile long. (11) According to a nationwide study, in 2016, roughly 3 percent of people standing in line at voting locations left before they could vote as a result of long lines. (12) The disenfranchisement that long lines create for voters is not limited to that one election. Research suggests that for each hour would-be voters wait, their probability of voting in the next election drops by 1 percentage point. (13) Congress has the authority under article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the United States to enact laws governing the time, place, and manner of Federal elections. (14) Congress also has authority under section 2 of the 15th Amendment to enforce the right of citizens of the United States to vote, which shall not be denied or abridged by the United States, by legislation.

(a) State Plans Required.--Title III of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 20901 et seq.) is amended-- (1) by redesignating sections 304 and 305 as sections 305 and 306; and (2) by inserting after section 303 the following new section: ``SEC. 304.

The bill finds that long waiting times are a significant barrier to voting participation, particularly for communities of color, the young, elderly, and low-income citizens. Long wait times may lead to a decrease in voter turnout over time. 

The bill requires states to make and publicly post a plan 60 days before Federal elections describing measures it will undertake to ensure equitable waiting times for all voters and ideally, a waiting time of less than 30 minutes at any polling station. After each election, the Commission will review waiting times and publicly report its findings. 

If a significant number of voters had to wait more than 60 minutes to vote or substantial violations of stated standards occurred, a State remedial plan will be implemented for the effective allocation of resources to administer elections and reduce waiting times. The bill also includes provisions for emergency paper ballots and sets minimum requirements for voting systems, poll workers, and election resources.

9342, Working to Help Ensure Equity for Lithium-ion-powered Chairs on Airplanes Act or the WHEELChairs on Airplanes Act This bill directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to conduct an annual survey on all carriers and foreign air carriers to compile the policies regarding lithium-ion battery-powered wheelchairs and mobility aids of each U.S. air carrier and foreign air carrier and determine whether any of the policies are more restrictive than FAA safety standards or inconsistent with FAA standards for adequate protection. The bill requires air carriers with inconsistent or more restrictive policies than the FAA and those that do not have a policy in effect to update their policies.," A BILL To amend title 49, United States Code, to prevent discrimination against airline passengers with disabilities who use lithium-ion- powered wheelchairs and mobility aids that are safe for air travel, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Working to Help Ensure Equity for Lithium-ion-powered Chairs on Airplanes Act'' or the ``WHEELChairs on Airplanes Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-435; 100 Stat. 1080), adding a provision now codified in section 41705 of title 49, United States Code, prohibiting disability-based discrimination in air transportation. (2) Despite this effort, individuals with disabilities continue to experience significant barriers to and with traveling in air transportation. (3) The Department of Transportation's Airline Passengers with Disabilities Bill of Rights specifies that ``airlines must accept a battery powered wheelchair, if it fits in the cargo compartment and can be transported consistent with safety and security requirements''. (4) Wheelchairs and other mobility aids powered by lithium- ion batteries are growing in prevalence, as lithium-ion batteries are light-weight and can extend a device's range between charges. (5) Airline passengers with disabilities who travel with lithium-ion-powered wheelchairs or mobility aids have been arbitrarily and erroneously denied boarding despite presenting documentation that their devices meet all applicable safety standards. (6) As the popularity of lithium-ion-powered wheelchairs and mobility aids continues to increase, so will the frequency of instances when airline passengers with disabilities are erroneously and arbitrarily denied boarding. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that an air carrier or foreign air carrier that denies an airline passenger with a disability who use a lithium-ion-powered wheelchair or mobility aid that meets all applicable safety standards for air travel should be considered to have violated such passenger's rights under section 41705 of title 49, United States Code, and therefore, all air carriers and foreign air carriers must maintain clear policies pertaining to lithium-ion battery-powered wheelchairs and mobility aids that are no more restrictive than all applicable safety standards. SEC. 3. ANNUAL SURVEY OF AIR CARRIER AND FOREIGN AIR CARRIER LITHIUM- ION BATTERY POLICIES FOR WHEELCHAIRS AND MOBILITY AIDS. (a) In General.--Subchapter I of chapter 417 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``Sec. 41727.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Las Americas Energy Security Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE; STATEMENT OF POLICY. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) Energy independence and security are critical for a country to maintain its sovereignty and independence. (2) The International Energy Agency (``IEA'') defines energy security as the uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price. (3) The IEA defines long-term energy security as primarily dealing with timely investments to supply energy in line with economic developments and environmental needs. (4) The IEA defines short-term energy security as focusing on the ability of a country's energy system to react promptly to sudden changes in the supply-demand balance. (5) The IEA found in February 2022 that Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine poses serious implications for international energy security. (6) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations body that provides regular assessments on climate change, issued its sixth report in February 2022, and found that ``human-induced climate change, including more frequent and intense extreme events, has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people, beyond natural climate variability''. (7) The IPCC notes that to avoid mounting loss of life, biodiversity, and infrastructure, we must have ambitious, accelerated action to adapt to climate change, while also making rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. (8) The World Meteorological Organization's State of the Climate in Latin America and the Caribbean 2020 report found that-- (A) widespread drought across Latin America and the Caribbean has had significant impact on inland shipping routes, crop yields, and food production, and consequently led to worsening food insecurity; (B) extreme weather events affected more than 8 million people across Central America, exacerbating food insecurity in countries already crippled by economic shocks, COVID-19 impacts, and conflict; and (C) sea-level rise poses a major risk to low-lying coastal zones in the Latin America and the Caribbean. (9) Climate change is projected to increase the displacement of people and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that an average of 21.5 million people have been forcibly displaced by weather-related sudden onset hazards every year since 2008. (10) Rising commodity and energy prices, as well as other global economic shocks such as those caused by natural disasters, pandemics, and conflict pose a serious security risk that may lead to social unrest and instability in Latin America and the Caribbean. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United States has economic and national security interests in assisting Latin America and the Caribbean to achieve sustainable energy security. (c) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States-- (1) to advance United States foreign policy and development goals by helping Latin America and the Caribbean meet its short-term energy needs; (2) to promote the energy security of Latin America and the Caribbean by encouraging the development of accessible, transparent, competitive, and solvent energy markets that provide diversified sources, types, and routes of energy, prioritizing clean energy sources that reduce carbon emissions and address climate change; (3) to encourage United States public and private sector investment in Latin American and Caribbean energy infrastructure projects to bridge the gap between energy security and commercial demand in a way that is consistent with the region's current absorptive capacity, and that recognizes the importance of building and widening the absorptive capacity of the region; (4) to help facilitate the export of United States energy resources, technology, and expertise to global markets in a way that benefits the comprehensive energy security of Latin America and the Caribbean; and (5) to assist partner countries in developing and strengthening regulatory frameworks that support energy security. SEC. 3. SOVEREIGN LENDING PROGRAM FOR ELIGIBLE LATIN AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN PARTNER COUNTRIES.

9162," Stop Our Scourge Act of 2022 or the SOS Act of 2022 This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to designate illicit fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction and requires the Office of National Drug Control Policy to conduct an assessment regarding that substance. Specifically, the office must assess  foreign manufacturing of illicit fentanyl, the tools and capabilities across federal agencies to address trafficking of that substance, the capabilities of the Mexican military to conduct counterdrug missions with respect to that substance,  the capacities and willingness of China to take specified actions with respect to that substance, and illicit fentanyl being trafficked into the United States from Mexico. "," A BILL To direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate illicit fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Our Scourge Act of 2022'' or the ``SOS Act of 2022''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The number of annual drug overdose deaths in the United States has quintupled since 1999. (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, deaths involving illicit fentanyl are on the rise, and the number of overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids in 2020 was more than 18 times the number in 2013. (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that in 2020 more than 56,000 people died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids (other than methadone) in the United States, accounting for over 82 percent of all opioid- involved deaths. (4) According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone (such as fentanyl) increased 56 percent, from 11.4 in 2019 to 17.8 in 2020 per 100,000 standard population. (5) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds that reports on increases in synthetic opioid-involved deaths ``are being driven by increases in fentanyl-involved overdose deaths, and the source of the fentanyl is more likely to be illicitly manufactured than pharmaceutical''. (6) In August 2021, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission published an issue brief noting that, in response to China's May 2019 fentanyl scheduling announcements, ``Chinese illegal fentanyl producers began seeking new ways to evade authorities, including developing new fentanyl precursors, working with traffickers in other countries, and using technology to avoid detection''. (7) According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, fentanyl is being mixed with other illicit drugs to increase the potency of the drug, sold as powders and nasal spray, and increasingly pressed into pills made to look like legitimate prescription opioids. (8) In an August 2022 op-ed, Dr. Rahul Gupta, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, wrote, ``While clandestinely produced drugs such as fentanyl hardly ever leave China in their final form, precursor chemicals for these drugs often are imported by criminals from China to Mexico, where lethal synthetic drugs are produced and trafficked to countries across the globe, including the U.S.''. (9) In fiscal year 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 12,900 pounds of illicit fentanyl, which was primarily manufactured in foreign laboratories and smuggled into the United States through Mexico--a sufficient quantity to kill over 2.9 billion people. (10) Current policies to counter the continued proliferation of illicit fentanyl have been shown to be inadequate at protecting the Nation's communities. SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF FENTANYL AS A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

9150," Red Listing Monterey Bay Aquarium Act This bill prohibits federal funds from being appropriated, awarded, or granted to the Monterey Bay Aquarium located in Monterey, California."," A BILL To provide that no Federal funds shall be appropriated, awarded, or granted to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Red Listing Monterey Bay Aquarium Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds as follows: (1) Lobstering has served as an economic engine and family tradition in Maine and the other New England States for centuries. (2) The lobster fishery supports thousands of families who make their livelihoods from catching, processing, or serving lobsters, employing people of all ages year-round, with many harvesters beginning as children and staying in the industry for their entire working lives. (3) Maine's lobster fishery alone has an estimated ex- vessel value of $725,000,000, generating more than $1,000,000,000 in economic activity and supporting more than 15,500 jobs throughout the supply chain. (4) The Maine lobster industry has spearheaded sustainability measures for more than 150 years, ensuring the health of the lobster stock and the marine environment through the following: (A) In 1872, Maine passed the first law banning taking of egg-bearing female lobster. (B) In 1874, Maine passed the first laws regulating the minimum size of lobster that could be harvested. (C) In 1948, Maine passed a requirement that fishermen mark female, egg-bearing lobsters with a V- shaped notch. (D) In 1997, Maine lobstermen removed all surface floating rope and, in 2009, replaced an estimated 27,000 miles of floating line with whale-safe sinking lines. (E) In 2015, Maine lobstermen adjusted their gear in certain areas to a newly required minimum number of traps per buoy, reducing the amount of vertical rope present in the water by an additional 3,000 miles. (F) In 2022, lobstermen converted their gear once again, including more ``weak links'', more ``weak rope'' and more traps per buoy to further reduce vertical line in the water column, in addition to removing nearly 1,000 miles of gear from prime fishing grounds. (5) These measures are the reason why there has never been a serious injury or death of the endangered North Atlantic right whale attributed to the Maine lobster fishery and there has not been a known right whale entanglement with Maine lobster gear since 2004. (6) According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the majority of known right whale deaths since 2017 have been attributed to vessel strikes in Canada and of the 33 right whale mortalities occurring between 2017 and 2020, 24 of those whales were confirmed to be attributed to entanglements in Canadian fishing gear and vessel strikes in Canadian waters. (7) Despite these facts, Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program added the American lobster fishery to a ``red list'' of seafood that consumers should avoid due to the risk that the fishery poses to right whales. (8) This red list designation for American lobster by Seafood Watch is speculative and conjecture, not supported by the data or the science as they state in their report, ``until there is more specific information available regarding which fisheries are responsible for the unattributed entanglements, Seafood Watch considers that all relevant fisheries that may overlap with North Atlantic right whales pose risks''. (9) In their own press release announcing the red listing for American lobster, Seafood Watch states, ``More than 90% of entanglements cannot be linked to a specific gear type, and only 12% of entanglements can be linked to a specific location.''. (10) Monterey Bay Aquarium ignores the efforts by the lobster industry to reduce their risk to right whales for the past 150 years, admitting in their report that ``effects on mitigation of whale entanglement have yet to be determined''. (11) This new, unsubstantiated designation has a real world impact; with the lobster industry already facing challenges, the inaccurate designation will hurt the thousands of hardworking lobstermen, their families, and businesses across Maine and has already prompted seafood retailers such as Blue Apron and HelloFresh to pull lobster from their menus. (12) Monterey Bay's Seafood Watch Program has produced recommendations that rely on pseudoscientific claims and false assumptions that ignore scientific principles that should underpin any legitimate ratings and, by ignoring the facts, Seafood Watch is not encouraging safe fishing, but rather damaging the reputation of its certification process by smearing an entire industry and misleading consumers. (13) Monterey Bay Aquarium receives millions of Federal taxpayer dollars for scientific research and to promote ocean conservation and seafood sustainability, yet the Monterey Bay Aquarium has irresponsibly ignored scientific facts and the lobster fishery's history of sustainability.
